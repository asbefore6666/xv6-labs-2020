Q1：Which registers contain arguments to functions? For example, which register holds 13 in main's call to printf?
A1: a0-a7; a2;

Q2: Where is the call to function f in the assembly code for main? Where is the call to g? (Hint: the compiler may inline functions.)
A2: There is none. g(x) is inlined within f(x) and f(x) is further inlined into main()

Q3: At what address is the function printf located?
A3: 0000000000000630, 不同的编译器这个地址不同

Q4: What value is in the register ra just after the jalr to printf in main?
A4: 0x38

Q5: Run the following code.
	unsigned int i = 0x00646c72;
	printf("H%x Wo%s", 57616, &i);
What is the output?
A5: HE110 World; %x是指16进制打印；i=0x00646c72, 字节翻译是0dlr. 因为RISC-V是little-endian, 存放在连续内存里的顺序即是rld0.如果RISC-V是big-endian, 57616不用变, i需要变成0x726c6400

Q6: In the following code, what is going to be printed after 'y='? (note: the answer is not a specific value.) Why does this happen?
    printf("x=%d y=%d", 3);
A6: 不确定；是打印留在a2寄存器中的任意随机值。
